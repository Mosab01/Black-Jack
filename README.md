# Blackjack
Welcome to Blackjack, the command-line version of the classic card game.

# Installation
To play the game, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine and run the Blackjack.cpp file using a C++ compiler.

# How to Play
The game starts with the player and the dealer being dealt two cards each.
The player's cards will be displayed face up, while one of the dealer's cards will be hidden.
The player will be prompted to either hit or stand.
Hitting will deal the player an additional card.
Standing will keep the player's current hand and move to the next step.
If the player goes over 21, they lose the game immediately.
If the player stands, the dealer will reveal their hidden card and hit or stand based on a set of predetermined rules.
The winner will be determined by who has the hand closest to 21 without going over.
The result of the game will be displayed on the command line.
You can play as many rounds as you'd like.
Technologies Used
The game is built using C++.
